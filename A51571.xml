            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE diſadvantages that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications have met with of late, by reaſon of the Flatteries that have been contained in them, have rendred them ſuſpected of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, although not in the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:59846:3"/> intended; That your Grace may not ſuffer in this too common a calamity, this Enſuing Treatiſe offers it ſelf to come into the critical Cenſures of the World, under the Auſpices of your Graces Protection: having the Aid and Countenance of ſo great and Noble a Perſonage prefixt, may in ſome manner take off the hard conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a great many. It is not to be queſtioned, but ſome will be apt to eſteem it an audacious Enterprize to undertake to give an account of the <hi>Preſent State of Scotland,</hi> a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ſo Antient, as none in the World can exceed; a Government ſo well Eſtabliſhed in Church and State, that it ſeems by ſerious Reflection, that the Laws and Statutes of both
<pb facs="tcp:59846:3"/> are inviolable: I ſay, My Lord, I may be called into queſtion why ſo great a Conamen became the Subject of my Studies at this time, when ſo many Learned and ſagacious Scholars of that Kingdom have declined ſo uſeful an Undertaking: To confeſs ingeniouſly, my thoughts have been perpetually bent to ſerve my Country in ſome degree or other, whereby I might manifeſt to the World the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that is due to ſo Antient a Kingdom, in which by a Lawful and Legitimate Deſcent of the Crown to this preſent King, being an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Monarchy, and an Imperial Crown; none of the European Kings can hardly equal. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſerving my Country was
<pb facs="tcp:59846:4"/> much prompted, when none yet have publiſhed a Treatiſe apart concerning the conſtitutions of ſo well a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kingdom: If I ſhall be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to ſuffer any way by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to ſatisfie the World what my reſpects are for ſo well a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Government, your Grace, I hope, will interpoſe for me, knowing that no ſiniſter end was propoſed.</p>
            <p>My Lord, conſider how regularly every Officer, from the higheſt to the loweſt degree, move in the ſphere of their Truſt, being ready to execute the Commands of their Maſter the King. Conſider how piouſly the Church is governed, in all things ſubmitting to Lawful Authority: conſider their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline, that ſcarce
<pb facs="tcp:59846:4"/> any of the leaſt Enormities in Life, or Errours in Judgment, can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſcape the ſevere Execution of the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. Theſe things conſidered, with that due reſpect they alwaies had and have for their Kings and the Royal Family, will kindle in your Grace ſuch eſteem for this Kingdom, as thoſe have had, who were your Predeceſſors of the great Honours you now enjoy.</p>
            <p>My Lord, the Dukes of <hi>Lenox,</hi> of whom your Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative, have been great Lovers of their Country, which they have te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified ſo demonſtrably to the world by the ſeveral great Offices they have performed, that their memory to this day is in great eſteem: They had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb facs="tcp:59846:5"/> an immediate Acceſs to their King, whom they were pleaſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of the condition of his Loyal Subjects, and often did Patronize the Affairs, and Eſpouſe the Intereſt of His Majeſties good Subjects; which to this day cannot be forgot.</p>
            <p>Your Grace needs nothing to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Name famous in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being you bear that Honourable Title of <hi>Lenox,</hi> but an inclination to ſucceed them in ſuch like performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; all their Tranſactions have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them and the Succeſſors of their Dignity Honourable in the Kingdom. Nature ſeems to warrant a Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Heroick Actions, which begin to appear in your Grace in theſe your greener years. Let then the thoughts of
<pb facs="tcp:59846:5"/> advancing the Interest of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, become as Dear to your Grace, as it was to your Noble Anceſtors of the ſame Dignity, that when become a Cedar in the Trust of the Affairs of State, you may gain the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is due to your Titles.</p>
            <p>My Lord, The great Truſt His Majeſty is pleaſed to commit to his great Officers of State, is exceeding honourable, and becoming an aſpiring Genius; moſt of the Antientest of the Nobility esteeming it a greater honour to have His Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion for ſuch Offices, than to bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy the Dignity of their Honours. It may justly merit your Graces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the great Officers of State have been of the prime of the
<pb facs="tcp:59846:6"/> Nobility, and have been very faithful in their Trust. It was upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that I preſumed to offer this Treatiſe to come into the World with your Graces Name prefixt, that it might be known that the Family of <hi>Lenox</hi> is not extinct, which is the great prudence of our Prince, that ſo Loyal a Family ſhould not be buried in Oblivion: And likewiſe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was, to give your Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e and the World a Testimony of the Eſteem I have for a Repreſentative of that Noble Family, who may in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability acquit himſelf as becomes one of that Esteem and Dignity.</p>
            <p>This ſmall Treatiſe may afford your Grace an occaſion to divert your ſelf ſometimes with the proſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:59846:6"/> the things contained in it, and thereby make you eaſie to understand the constitution of the Government, and to declare to the World that this Kingdom is not inferiour to any in reſpect of its Laws and Statutes, whereby the King's Prerogatives are great, and the Property of the Subject is fully ſecured by Law, the People having great Liberties and Freedoms.

            <p>IF it were the Cuſtom of the Heroick Spirits of this Age to diſapprove every thing that is not the <hi>Soboles</hi> of their own Brains, or the reſult of their own undertakings, then might I juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcouraged to appear with this ſmall demonſtration of my Service to my Country; but being otherwaies perſuaded of the generous Principles of this Age, that nothing which any way tends to the advancing

               <p>According to its Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it is divided into two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſcow;</hi> theſe two Provinces into ſeveral Dioceſſes: It was long after the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion was received in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that the Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thus divided: For more full ſatisfaction of the Affairs of the Church, the inquiſitive Reader may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59846:16"/> conſult the moſt Reverend Archbiſhop <hi>Spotiſwood,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Chriſtian Religion in the Year of our Lord 203. which was the fourth year of <hi>Donald</hi> the firſt, was publickly eſtabliſhed; the King with his Queen, and many of the Nobility being then baptized; ſeveral years before this publick ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation, many people were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> who liv'd ſome years before the Coronation of this King, ſpeaking of the Propagations of the Goſpel throughout the whole World, doth reckon among other Countries, the Parts of <hi>Britanny,</hi> unto which the <hi>Romans</hi> could not find acceſs: And what theſe Parts were, are no doubt that little corner of the Iſland which the <hi>Scots</hi> did inhabit; all the Inland of <hi>Britanny</hi> being ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be Authors of no ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who tranſmit to poſterity, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59846:17"/> St. <hi>Paul</hi> after his Impriſonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> did viſit this Iſland, and did Preach the Goſpel in the utmoſt parts thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nicephorus</hi> writeth, that <hi>Simon Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotes</hi> after he had travelled through <hi>Egypt, Cyrene, Africk, Mauritania,</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> came at laſt <hi>ad occidentalem oceanum inſulaſque Britannicas:</hi> and there Preached the Goſpel: <hi>Dorotheus</hi> addeth, that he was Crucified in theſe parts: Others write, as if Pope <hi>Victor</hi> did ſend Preachers, as firſt promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Goſpel: but this is not very probable, being this Church, was not faſhioned like to that of <hi>Rome</hi> in its rites, eſpecially in the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe foregoing opinions are not grounded upon the ſureſt teſtimonies of Hiſtory; the writers of moſt credit give place to this conjecture: That when the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd into the Iſle <hi>Pathmos,</hi> ſome of his Diſciples took their refuge hither, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59846:17"/> were the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel: The more ſober are inclinable to give credit to this, becauſe in that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moved about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here for ſome two hundred years after did retain the cuſtom of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental Church, maintaining this by the Authority of St. <hi>John,</hi> from whom they pleaded to have received the Faith: Others are agreed that not long after the Aſcenſion of our Lord, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> yet lived, that the Faith of our Lord was known and embraced in this Kingdom: <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith that they are to be numbred <hi>inter primitias,</hi> among the firſt Fruits of the Gentiles gathered unto Chriſt: This made <hi>Petrus Cluniacenſis</hi> call the <hi>Scots antiquiores Chriſtianos,</hi> of greater an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity than many others.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59846:18"/> much by it: The heat in Summer is leſs ſcorching than in ſome parts of the Continent: There is no need of Stoves in Winter, nor Grottes in Summer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soil.</hi> The Soil is very wholſome, abounding with Springs and Streams; there are ſome Navigable Rivers very convenient for Trade. Towards the North it's Mountainous, yet not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fruitful Valleys apt for Grain, Corn, or Wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Commodities.</hi> There is plenty eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where of Sheep, Oxen, and Coneys, and in the North, of fallow Deer: great plenty of Hens, Ducks, Geeſe, Turkeys and Pigeons, Partridges, Sea-plover, Pewits, Woodcocks, Snipes, Plovers, Quails, Larks, and Herons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with great plenty of Salmon, Trouts, Carps and Pikes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a great abundance of Herrings, Oyſters, Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, Muſles, Scate, Turbots, Freſhling, and Lobſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there is not wanting Apples, Pears, Plums and Cherries: It abounds with Wheat, Barley, Rye,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59846:18"/> Beans, Peaſe and Oats; as alſo Butter and Cheeſe: There are likewiſe wild Ducks, wild Geeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many ſorts of Sea Foul; for Raiment, there is no want of very fine Wooll; for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try People are cloath'd with freezes fit to defend them in their work from the cold: There is likewiſe plenty of Hemp and Flax; as for linnen Cloath it is inferiour to none for its goodneſs.</p>
               <p>For Building it wants not Stone, Slate, Alabaſter, Marble, Morter nor Lime.</p>
               <p>For firing, Sea Coal, or Pit Coal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where at reaſonable rates, and where this is wanting, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Wood, and in others Turfs or Peats.</p>
               <p>Moreover <hi>Scotland</hi> produceth a great quantity of Tin, Lead, Copper, Allom, Salt, Hops with ſeveral ſilver Mines: it is counted to be richer under ground then above, by reaſon of the Mines, which when tryed, yield much in their quantities of <hi>Ore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coyns.</hi> As to the Coyns, note
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59846:19"/> that 13½ <hi>d. ſterl.</hi> makes a Mark, or 13 Shil. 4 <hi>d. Scotiſh,</hi> 20 <hi>d. ſterl.</hi> is 20 Shil. or a <hi>Scotiſh l.</hi> and 20 Shil. <hi>ſterl.</hi> is 18 <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Marks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meaſures, and Weights.</hi> The Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for length is the Ell, and is about 4 <hi>per cent.</hi> greater than the Engliſh Ell.</p>
               <p>The liquid Meaſures are ſuch as are in <hi>England</hi> but of a double continent: a Pint being almoſt two Engliſh Quarts, and a Scotiſh Quart one Engliſh Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and ſo anſwerable: Their dry Meaſures are likewiſe of a bigger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent than theſe in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buildings.</hi> The Churches are of ſolid Stone; moſt of the Cathedral and Collegiate Churches demoliſhed, and by what remains of ſome, may be judged to have been very ample and magnificent. The firſt Reformers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more zealous than prudent, in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the very foundation moſt of the renowned Abbies and Churches: Houſes in Cities are built with Stone, and in many places covered with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59846:19"/> Slate: The Houſes of the Nobility and Gentry are well furniſhed; being all built with Stone; not much valuing Tile or Brick.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the Laws of</hi> Scotland: <hi>The Names of Kings, the Kings Power and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, how long the Crown hath been in the Family of the</hi> Stewarts, <hi>what a convention of Eſtates is.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> is made up of the Municipal and Civil Laws: The Municipal conſiſts either of Acts of Parliament, or of the Cuſtom, and Practices of the Colledge of Juſtice; which are held of no leſs force than Acts of Parliament, and when neither of theſe contradicts; the Civil Law is of force: The Lawyers being generally great Civilians, for they go to <hi>Leiden, Poictiers</hi> or <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> to ſtudy the Civil Law, in which ſome are learned to a high degree.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:59846:20"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Regiſters.</hi> The Law of <hi>Scotland</hi> is eaſy and regular, by reaſon of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, which are ſo full, that Titles are much more eaſily learned where thoſe Regiſters are, than can be done without them; by this means, Men are not cheated in buying or convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtates; which may appear from theſe following inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No man can have a right to any Eſtate, but by his being ſeiſed of it; which is done by the delivery of Earth, and Stone, upon which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is formed, called a <hi>Saſine,</hi> and this muſt be regiſter'd within 60 days: otherwiſe it is of no force; by which means all ſecret conveyances are cut off; for if no <hi>Saſine</hi> be paſt upon them; or if theſe be not put in the Regiſters, (which every one may ſearch) the conveyance is of no force.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Bonds have a clauſe in them for inſerting them in the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, and they being Regiſter'd, without any further action, by a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59846:21"/> Charge of ſix days the Debtor muſt make payment, otherwaies, Writs called Letters of Horning Caption, and Poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are given out, by the firſt of which, the party is under outlawery and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and forfeits to the King his Perſonal Eſtate: and if he continues a year under it, the liferent of his real Eſtate; in which the Creditor is to be prefer'd for his intereſt; the reſt goes into the Exchequer: By the Letters of Caption the party is ſeized on, and put in Priſon; nor is his Houſe a place of ſecurity, but may be ſearched for him; by the Letters of poynding the Debtors Goods may be diſtrained, wherever they can be found.</p>
               <p>A third inſtance is, that any Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor may ſerve a Writ on his Debtor, called Letters of Inhibition, by which he can make no diſpoſition of his goods, or Eſtate, till the party be ſatisfied; and is <hi>null</hi> and to no effect that he doth after, if theſe Letters be returned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd within 21 days after they are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59846:21"/> ſerved; otherwaies they have no force: thus this ancient Kingdom is govern'd by the Civil Law as in many other things might be inſtanced, by which they ſecurely enjoy what they have or may purchaſe.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been govern'd by Kings, in as long a Succeſſion as any Nation in the World as by this enſuing Catalogue of the Kings may appear, each of them lineal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeding others, ſince <hi>Ferguſius,</hi> the firſt King, in the year from the Creation of the World 3641.</p>

               <p> The King is an abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Monarch, and (as the Law calls him) a free Prince of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power, having as great Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Prerogatives by the Laws of this Realm, and priviledge of his Crown and Diadem, as any other King or Potentate whatſoever; ſo that is deliver'd as a maxim in the heads of our Law.</p>
               <q>That<hi rend="sup">o</hi> all juriſdiction ſtands and conſiſts in the Kings Perſon, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Royal Authority, and Crown, and is competent to no Subject; but flows and proceeds from the King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſupream juriſdiction; and is given and committed by him to his Subjects, as he pleaſes, which clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates his Royal Prerogative.</q>
               <p>The Crown deſcends by Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the Heir female, not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and to this day the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59846:24"/> Right to it, has been above three hundred years in the family of the <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warts,</hi> and is now in the Perſon of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Title is <hi>Dei Gratia</hi> of <hi>Scotland, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, whom God long preſerve in the Throne of his Anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; upon the Death of a King there is no <hi>Inter-Regnum;</hi> the next Heir is preſently King, the Coronation being only a ſolemn Inſtalment, in that which was his right before: before their Coronation, they hold only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Eſtates, but no Parliaments before they are Crowned.</p>
               <p>A Convention of Eſtates is made up of the ſame Members that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Parliament; but can make no Laws, only they can lay impoſitions on the Subjects. They do not ſit in State; they have been moſt uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kings were Crowned: the Lord Chancellor is preſident in the Convention of Eſtates as well as in Parliaments.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59846:24"/>
               <p> When a King is Crowned, he ſwears the Oath appointed to be taken at the Coronation: which before the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was no other, than that ſet down in the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontificial, ſworn by Kings, for there is no proviſion made about it in our Law; but at the Reformation it was enacted, <hi>That all Kings at the time of their Coronation, ſhould make their faithful promiſe by Oath to govern according to Law, and maintain the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which Oath is to be found in that Act of the firſt Parlia.</hi> Jac. 6. C. 8. Anno 1567.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prerogatives of the Crown.</hi> The Prerogatives of the Crown are great, as Power of Peace, and War, the Power of raiſing, and arming the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Power of the Mint, the nomination of all Officers both of State and of War, and of Juſtice: (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome Sheriffs that are ſuch by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance) the Power of calling, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing (Prorogation is not in our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59846:25"/> Law) and diſſolving of Parliaments, the giving the Votes of Parliament, the Authority of Laws, the executing of the Law, and the pardoning of offences, are wholly and only in the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Church Government.</hi> But to theſe, ſince His Majeſties Happy Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, great additions hath been made: In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the ſixth, the Power of general Aſſemblies was raiſed very high by Law, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the ſad diſaſter in the Church, and laid a foundation to all the late troubles of the State, notwithſtanding the Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs was alwaies in the Crown, ſince the Reformation: yet it was pretended as contrary to Law, for the King to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce any thing into the Church, without the conſent of the general Aſſembly: It was therefore enacted in Parliament, <hi>Act</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Parl.</hi> held by the Duke of <hi>Lauderdale:</hi> That the external Government and polity of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59846:25"/> the Church was wholly in the King's Power; and that his Order ſent to the Privy Council, and publiſhed by them, about all Eccleſiaſtical Matters, Meetings and Perſons were to be obeyed by his Subjects, any Law or practice to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: So that in all matters that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Church-Government, the King's Power is abſolute.</p>
               <p>

                  <p> In the middle of the four there are two Tables; on the one whereof the <hi>Regalia</hi> are laid, and in two great Chairs by them, ſit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and the Mareſchal; at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Table ſits the Lord Clerk of Regiſters, with his Deputy Clerks, who are the Clerks of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo Forms placed on the Floor; theſe on the Right ſide are for the Commiſſioners of the Shires; and theſe on the Left for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Burroughs. When all are placed, the Parliament is fenced (as the phraſe is) in the King's Name: Then the King ſpeaks to them, if he be preſent, in his Robes with the Crown on his head, all ſtanding up bare headed: But when a Commiſſioner repreſents him, he is in an ordinary Sute, and ſtands and ſpeaks alſo bare-headed (nor is the Commiſſioner covered when there is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59846:55"/> pleading at the Bar, but continues bare-headed as all the Members are) and tells them the reaſon for which they are called together, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the Lord Chancellor.</p>
                  <p>The next thing to be done, is the Chuſing of the Lords of the Articles, which is a matter of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who are eight of every State, who have been choſen different waies: Sometimes the Biſhops did Chuſe the Eight Lords; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Nobility the Eight Biſhops. At other times the Nobility did Chuſe their own Eight, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops their Eight: But now it is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by an Act of Parliament, that the King, or His Commiſſioner names Eight of the Biſhops; the Lords Chuſe Eight for themſelves; and theſe Sixteen do Chuſe Eight Commiſſioners for the Shires, and Eight for the Burroughs: Theſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59846:55"/> Thirty two are the Committee of Parliament, to prepare matters: When a Bill is drawn by them, it is brought into the Parliament: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently all theſe Bills were brought in the laſt day of the Parliament, on which, the Members Ride in the ſame State, as they do the firſt, and the Bills being Read, they were put to the Votes of the Parliament, and then were approved, or not; being approved, were preſented to the King, who by touching them with the Scepter, gives his aſſent to them, which is done by his Commiſſioner in his abſence; if he refuſe to touch them, they are of no force: Matters have been fully and freely debated in Parliament: Sitting all in one Houſe, every one anſwers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to his Name, and gives his Vote, which is in theſe terms, <hi>I approve, or not approve;</hi> only theſe who are not ſatisfied one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59846:56"/> way or another, ſay <hi>Non liquet,</hi> which is a great eaſe to thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious, and a common refuge to the cunning Politician: The <hi>major</hi> Vote carries it: No Diſſents or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts are allowed in publick Acts; theſe are accounted Treaſonable; but in private Acts that relate to mens Properties and Rights, any one may proteſt for his Intereſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all buſineſs is ended, the King or his Commiſſioner makes a Speech to the Parliament Aſſembled, after which they are Diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the King His Majeſty makes uſe of a Convention of Eſtates, which can make no Laws; only by this Meeting Impoſitions are laid upon the Subjects: they do not Sit in State; and have been moſt in uſe before the Kings were Crowned.</p>
                  <p>Whatever Acts are paſſed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59846:56"/> or Convention of Eſtates, are to be proclaimed ſoon after the Diſſolution, at the publick Market-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> by the <hi>Lyon</hi> King at Arms, with a great deal of State and Ceremony; after which they are obligatory on the Subjects: And it is Enacted, that none of the Lieges ſhall preſume to impugn the Dignity and Authority of the Three Eſtates, or any of them in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under the pain of Treaſon; the Authority of the Parliament being the Supreme Court, it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to give a Liſt of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with their Precedency, which is as follows; with their Surnames.</p>

The Extraordinary Lords have no Salary, and are not obliged to Attendance; but when they come they have a Vote: This Court ſits from the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> till the laſt of <hi>July;</hi> and from the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> till <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve;</hi> and from the firſt of <hi>January,</hi>

                  <p>There is an Outer-houſe, and an Inner. In the Outer-houſe there is a Bench, where one of the Senators ſits a week (and all of them except the Preſident, have their Turns in it,) who hears all Cauſes originally; and where the caſe is clear, he gives ſentence: But if it be difficult, or if either party deſires it, he reports it to the reſt of the Senators, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſend out their Anſwer by him, or if it be very intricate, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or either of them deſire it, do appoint it to be heard before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This is a Court of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59846:67"/> But beſides the Judge upon the Bench, there is a ſide Bar; to which, one of the Judges comes out by turns weekly, as in the former, and receives and anſwers all Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Bills: The Inner-houſe, where all the reſt of the Senators ſit, is a Court of great State and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: The Senators ſit in a ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle in Robes; under them ſit their Clerks, who write all the moſt material heads of all that is pleaded at the Bar, where the pleadings are long, and very learned. When the the Senatours have (after all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are removed) conſidered their arguments, they give their ſentence, and the <hi>major</hi> part carries it: Their final ſentence determines all buſineſs in their Court, there lying no Appeal from them, only the Parliament as the Supreme Court may review and repeal their ſentence; their deciſive ſentence are called Decreets, from the Latine <hi>Decreta.</hi>

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have Commiſſioners in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beſides, are a State apart; for they meet yearly in a Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, called the Convention of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, from which a Commiſſioner comes from every one of them:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59846:77"/> There they make Laws for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about Trade, and other things relating to their Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They hold theſe Meetings in a Circu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In theſe Burroughs there is a Provoſt (or Mayor) who has the Chief Power; and there are four Bailiffs (or Aldermen) that are next to him in the Government: There is alſo a Dean of <hi>Gild,</hi> named among the <hi>Romans Aedilis,</hi> who is the Chief Judge among the Merchants; likewiſe a Treaſurer and a Common Council, the one half of which is choſen uſually by the Merchants, the other half by the Trades men once every year: The Trades men have a Court of their own, in which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59846:77"/> there is one from every Trade, who is called the Deacon of the Trade, and they chuſe one among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be Preſident in all their Meetings, and Affairs, who is call'd Deacon Conveener; by his Order they are to meet, as their buſineſs requires: Theſe Deacons are choſen yearly by all the Freemen of their Trade, and have a little juriſdiction over them: There are in moſt Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, great and dangerous Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Factions, between the Merchants and Trades-men upon the account of precedence, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick daies, when they meet.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1660 after a moſt grievous burthen of that inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable yoak, which our ſins had prepared, and other mens ſins had laid on us; after the Kingdom had groan'd nine years under the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Uſurpers, who to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat our miſeries, impriſoned, Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and miſerably butcher'd the Loyal Subjects, under the names of Malignants, Traitours, and Rebels; their Eſtates and Lands forfeited, and ſold, their Houſes garriſoned, plundered, and burnt, and their poſterity almoſt reduced to poverty, and miſery; Alaſs! Our Plough-ſhares

His Majeſty that he might ſettle his Kingdom, ſummoned his firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to meet at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the firſt of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1661 giving a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion under the great Seal to <hi>John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Middleton,</hi> to repreſent his Perſon therein: in the firſt Seſſion, the Solemn League and Covenant was condemned, as an unlawful, and wicked Oath, impoſed on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by a prevailing Faction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Authority: The pretended Triennial Parliaments from 1640

               <p>1662. In the ſecond Seſſion, the Antient Eccleſiaſtical Government of the Church was reſtored, to the exceeding joy and ſatisfaction of all his Majeſties good Subjects: This was done by an Almighty Power; the Covenanters having ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully defaced the Government of the Church, and rendered the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Office of a Biſhop con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59846:85"/> in the eyes of the People, that His Majeſties Reſtauration being ſo miraculouſly without ſhedding of blood, to be reſtored to his own Kingdoms, the Government of the Church with ſo little, or no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance ſettled; theſe things being conſidered, ought to be kept as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, not written ſuperficially, but with the point of a Diamond in the hearts of all Loyal Subjects.</p>

                  <p> The Revenues of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Clergy at preſent, are generally very ſmall and inſufficient: Many ſecret and indirect means have been uſed to leſſen their Rents, through corrupt Compoſitions and Compacts: They were moſt miſerably robb'd and ſpoiled of the greateſt part of their Lands, until King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth, who after he was come to Age, took particular care in reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſome Biſhopricks, what was moſt unjuſtly kept from them: Yea, at this day, a Gentleman of 200 <hi>l.</hi> Land Rent yearly, will not change his worldly eſtate and condition with ſeveral Biſhops: A Shopkeeper, a common Artiſan, will hardly change theirs with ordinary Paſtors of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The great diminution of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Clergy, &amp; the little care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of augmenting and defending the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59846:88"/> of the Church, is the great reproach and ſhame of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Reformation, and will, it's to be feared, prove one day, the ruine of Church and State.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervations of the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> concerning the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, may be applyed to ours: (How the Church was every day robb'd of her Dues, and that it was then an Opinion rife, that to give to the Church ſmelt of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, and Popery, and to take from the Church what our Anceſtors had given, was Reformation.) This pious Divine declared, that what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith in the 90th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> was likely to be verified of God's Service and Religion: The Time thereof may be Threeſcore years and Ten; if it continue till Fourſcore, it will be but ſmall joy to thoſe that ſhall then behold the condition of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59846:89"/> Church. The beſt Hiſtorian cannot produce one example of a happy ſtate, where the Clergy hath been expoſed to the contempt of the People; which muſt needs happen where their Benefices and Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances are ſcandalous, and their Perſons thereby rendred contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and deſpicable.</p>
                  <p>It is the laſt Trick, ſaith St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> that the Devil hath in the world, when he cannot bring the Word and Sacraments into diſgrace by Hereſies and Errours, he invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this project, to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and low eſteem; as it is now in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many as the droſs and refuſe of the Nation. Men think it a ſtain to their blood, to place their Sons in that Function; and Women are aſhamed to marry with any of them; whereas antiently the Function of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59846:89"/> the Clergy was of ſo high account and eſteem, that not only the beſt Gentry and Nobility, but divers of the Sons and Brothers of our <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Kings, diſdained not to enter into holy Orders, and to be Clergy-men; as at this day is practiſed in moſt other Monarchies in Chriſtendom: While this Policy laſted, the Clergy were judged the fitteſt perſons to execute moſt of the chief Offices and Places of the Kingdom, and the Laity did with much reverence and eſteem ſubmit to them. Great was the Authority of the Clergy in thoſe daies; and their memory ſhould now among us be precious: They were never wanting to the King, by their ſeaſonable Advice and Counſels.</p>
                  <p>But above all, we owe a great Reverence to the Biſhops, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Chriſtian
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59846:90"/> Religion, and to many of them, in being inſtrumental in reforming that Religion, when corrupted: And ſince that, the Maintenance thereof againſt all <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers, and of the Diſcipline thereof; againſt all the Practices and Power of the Schiſmaticks: All this, and more, is owing to Biſhops and Paſtors; by the late want of whom to ſit at the Stern, how ſoon was the Church ſplit upon the Rocks of Anarchy and confuſion: Notwithſtanding of their Worthineſs and Piety, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſtrangers, that the iniquity of the preſent Times in <hi>Scotland</hi> is ſuch, that the Orthodox Clergy are not only hated by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> on the one ſide, and maligned by the Schiſmaticks on the other ſide; but alſo, of all the Chriſtian Clergy of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether <hi>Romiſh, Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> or <hi>Calvinian,</hi> none are ſo little reſpected, obeyed, or rewarded, as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59846:90"/> the preſent Pious, Learned, Loyal and Orthodox Clergy of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> even by thoſe, who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies profeſſed themſelves of that Communion.</p>
                  <p>Having given an account of the Dignity of Biſhops, and the reſpect due to them; and the eſteem they have had even in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where, of late, their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors have been expoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and diſgrace.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the Reign of King <hi>Alexander</hi> the Second, <hi>Anno</hi> 121—there was a <hi>Studium Generale in Collegio Canonicorum;</hi> where there were Profeſſors and Doctors of Divinity, and of the Canon and Civil Laws; and many Learned men have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed therein.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Will. Elphinſtoun,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th, the priviledge of an Univerſity in <hi>Aberdeen Anno</hi> 1494. It is endowed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59846:122"/> with as ample priviledges as any Univerſity in Chriſtendom; and particularly the Foundation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the priviledges of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Bononia;</hi> but hath no reference to <hi>Oxford,</hi> or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> becauſe of the Wars between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at that time: The priviledges were afterwards confirmed by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th, <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Second; and by the Succeſſors of K. <hi>James</hi> the Fourth.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Chancellor of this Univerſity, and hath power to viſit in his own perſon, and to reform Abuſes: And although he be not a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, yet the foundation gives him power to confer that degree.</p>
               <p>The Office of Vice-Chancellor reſides in the Official or Commiſſary of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Rector, who is choſen yearly, with the Aſſiſtance of his Four Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59846:122"/> is to take notice of Abuſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Univerſity, and to make a return thereof to the Chancellor: If one of the Maſters happen to be Rector, then is his power devolved upon the Vice Chancellor.</p>
               <p>The Colledge was founded by Biſhop <hi>William Elphinſtone An.</hi> 1500. and was called the <hi>King's Colledge,</hi> becauſe King <hi>James</hi> the Fourth took upon him and his Succeſſors, the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial protection of it.</p>

               <p>A Principal, or Warden.</p>
               <p>A Profeſſour of Divinity.</p>
               <p>Four Maſters or Regents (for ſo they are called) of Philoſophy, a Profeſſor or Regent of Humanity <hi>(Humaniorum literarum)</hi> or Philology.</p>

               <p>Doctor <hi>Conradus Otto,</hi> a learned Jew, was the firſt Profeſſor.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59846:146"/> an Anſwer, that the ſeveral calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that have happened in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Kingdom, may juſtly ſerve for an Apology, when it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that after the Death of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the Third of that Name, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all his Sons, which in one years ſpace died of a peſtilent Fever, which was never before known in this Kingdom; his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being Queen of <hi>Norway,</hi> died in the ſame year, who left behind her a Daughter, whom after the Death of the King and his Sons, the Eſtates ſent for; to this effect Two Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors were diſpatcht to <hi>Norway,</hi> to take care of the ſafe conveyance of this Young Lady, the only hope the Kingdom relyed on: It was not long after theſe Gentlemen that were ſent to <hi>Norway</hi> returned, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing News that this Lady was dead likewiſe: Conſider what fears and ſorrows at the hearing of theſe News,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59846:146"/> did perplex the Subjects of this Kingdom: So many deaths falling out in the Royal Family, did preſage great calamities to enſue: For as the Loſs of ſo worthy a King was great; ſo their Fears was no leſs, becauſe of the uncertainty of the Succeſſion: Many Competitors (ſix they were in number) claiming the Inheritance of the Crown; and all of them, men of power and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: It muſt needs be ſuppoſed that they did divide the Realm, and ſo beget a Civil War; yet theſe who were truſted with the management of Affairs, during the Inter Reign, did by their Mediation, work them to a Compromiſe, and to remit the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Controverſie to King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Firſt of <hi>England,</hi> a Prince of long Experience, and much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected in that time: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe divers Gentlemen were ſent to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who at that time was
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59846:147"/> in <hi>France,</hi> to inform him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that were feared to fall out in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the courſe they had taken to prevent the ſame, intreating his help for quieting the State. King <hi>Edward,</hi> glad to have an hand in the making of a King in Scotland, dimitted them with many kind expreſſions of his kindneſs to the Kingdom, aſſigning a Dyet for the Competitors at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> upon <hi>Tweed;</hi> at which Dyet the King was preſent; at this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was no deciſion; all the Competitors except two, to wit, <hi>John Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> were ordered to ceaſe from their claim: Of <hi>Baliol</hi> and <hi>Bruce</hi> an Oath was taken, that they ſhould abide and ſtand by the Sentence the King ſhould pronounce. The like Oath was taken by the Prelates Nobles, and other Commiſſioners, who ſwore to accept of him for their
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59846:148"/> King, that would be tryed to have the beſt Right; and for the greater aſſurance, all their Seals were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to the Compromiſe.</p>
                  <p>Five years and ſome more were ſpent before the Controverſie was brought to an end: At laſt K. <hi>Edw.</hi> returned to <hi>Berwick,</hi> and calling the Twenty Four, to whom the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Affairs were committed, they were ſhut up in the Church, there to debate the Matter, none being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have acceſs unto them, he himſelf now and then went in to know how their proceedings went; and perceiving the greater part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Bruce</hi> his Right, he dealt with him, promiſing to inveſt him in the Kingdom, ſo as he would hold the ſame Crown of <hi>England: Bruce</hi> anſwered, that he was not ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Rule, as he would therefore prejudice the Liberties of the Kingdom, being it was ſufficiently
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59846:149"/> known that <hi>Scotland</hi> from the firſt Foundation of the State had been a Free and Independent Kingdom, and not ſubject to any other power whatſoever. The like offer he made to the other, who being more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Kingdom, than careful of his Honour, did yield thereunto. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Baliol</hi> aſſiſted with the Nobility, did meditate upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s proceedings with him in that Juncture of Time, by forcing <hi>Baliol</hi> to ſwear ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, at which the Nobility were ſo much diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <p>About this Time King <hi>Edward</hi> ſent to crave a ſupply of men to be ſent him by virtue of the Late Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance ſworn by <hi>Baliol,</hi> which was utterly rejected as unjuſt; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then War with <hi>France:</hi> Upon this defection of <hi>Baliol,</hi> King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> entered into <hi>Scotland</hi> with a mighty Army, and prevailed, <hi>Baliol</hi> being overthrown.</p>
